# AVOT Sandbox Kit

This folder provides a safe testing ground for AVOT roles using LLMs like ChatGPT Playground. 
It includes prompt templates, test cases, and output logs to simulate and debug AVOT behaviors before production deployment.

## Contents

- `agent_test_cases.md`: Test scenarios and inputs for sandbox trials.
- `example_response_outputs.json`: Output samples from previous test runs.
